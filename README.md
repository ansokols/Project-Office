# Project Office
## Overview
**Project Office** is a two-dimensional top-down shooter. The action of the game takes place in a large multi-story office building that has been taken over by unknown armed people. The main character is a former special agent. After coming to his senses, he does not understand where he is and how he got here, but he quickly realizes that something bad is happening - all the exits are blocked, and the building is full of armed people with unknown intentions. The main character's task is to get out of the building while trying to understand what is happening. The skills of a special agent and weapons captured from enemies will help him in this.
